# LinearRegressionStocks
Just some ML practice using Linear Regression, Quandl API and SKLearn 

Did a small project while learning about Linear Regression and stock prediction.
Data was from Quandl Wiki. Data is only up to 2018 and anything beyond that is on a paid tier.


Linear Regression is generally not a good indicator of stocks, which is why I used stock data from companies like AAPL or AMZN to demonstrate how it will look like.
Usually stocks move very erraticaly but considering the amount and the period of the data we had I figured it would show a nice graph.
